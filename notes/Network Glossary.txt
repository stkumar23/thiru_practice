ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)
    The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a network protocol used to map Internet Protocol (IP)
    addresses to Media Access Control (MAC) addresses within a Local Area Network (LAN). It's essential
    for communication because devices use IP addresses to identify each other, but actual communication
    at the physical layer (like Ethernet) uses MAC addresses. ARP allows devices to discover the MAC
    address associated with a known IP address, enabling them to send data packets to the correct
    destination.

FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
    FTP is a protocol used for transferring files between two hosts. Just like telnet and HTTP,
    one host runs the FTP server application (or daemon) and is called the FTP server while the
    FTP client runs the FTP client application. A client connecting to the FTP server may be
    required to authenticate before being given access to the file structure. Once authenticated,
    the client can view directory listings, get and send files, and perform some other file
    related functions.

ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)
    ICMP takes care of error-handling in the network.
    It's primarily used for diagnostics and troubleshooting IP networks, particularly for
    testing connectivity, packet loss, and delay.

IP (Internet Protocol)
    IP is for communication between computers. IP is a “connection-less” communication protocol.
     IP is responsible for “routing” each packet to the correct destination.

IP Spoofing
    It refers to the creation of Internet Protocol (IP) packets with a false
    source IP address to impersonate another computer system.

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
    TCP is used for transmission of data from an application to the network.
    It is a fundamental internet protocol that ensures reliable and ordered delivery of data
    packets between devices. It is responsible for breaking the data down into IP packets before
    they are sent, and for assembling the packets when they arrive. If one application wants
    to communicate with another via TCP, it sends a communication request. This request must be 
    sent to an exact address. After a “handshake” between the two applications, TCP will set up
    a “full-duplex” communication between the two applications. The “full-duplex” communication
    will occupy the communication line between the two computers until it is closed by one of
    the two applications.

    TCP is used in a wide variety of applications that require reliable data transfer, including:
    * Web browsing (HTTP)
    * Email (SMTP, POP3, IMAP)
    * File transfer (FTP)
    * Remote login (SSH)

Telnet
    Telnet is a terminal emulation protocol used to access the resourses of a remote host.
    A host, called the Telnet server, runs a telnet server application (or daemon in Unix terms)
    that receives a connection from a remote host called the Telnet client. This connection is
    presented to the operating system of the telnet server as though it is a terminal connection
    connected directly (using keyboard and mouse). It is a text-based connection and usually
    provides access to the command line interface of the host.

TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol)
    It is a stripped down version of FTP. Where FTP allows a user to see a directory listing and
    perform some directory related functions, TFTP only allows sending and receiving of files.
    It is a small and fast protocol, but it does not support authentication. Because of this
    inherent security risk, it is not widely used.

UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
    UDP is a network protocol used for data transmission. It's known for its speed and efficiency,
    particularly in time-sensitive applications, but it doesn't guarantee reliable delivery or
    packet order. UDP is connectionless, meaning it doesn't require a handshake or established
    connection before sending data.

    Usecases:
    * VoIP
    * Streaming
    * Online Gaming
    * DNS lookup
