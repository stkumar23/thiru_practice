systemd
-------
  Systemd is a system and service manager for Linux operating systems.
  When run as first process on boot (as PID 1), it acts as init system that
  brings up and maintains userspace services.

  Key features:
    * Parallel Startup: Systemd speeds up the boot process by starting
      services in parallel, reducing overall startup time.
    * On-Demand Activation: Services can be started on-demand, optimizing
      resource usage and improving system performance.
    * Unit Files: Systemd uses unit files to define and manage services,
      sockets, devices, mount points and other system resources.
    * Integrated Logging and Monitoring: Systemd integrates with 'journalctl'
      for centralized logging and monitoring of system events.

  In systemd, unit is a confgiuration file that defines a system resource or
  service. Different types of unit files based on their purpose:
    * Service units (.service): Manage system services
    * Socket units (.socket): Manage socket activation for services
    * Target units (.target): Group units together for synchronization purposes,
      similar to runlevels
    * Mount units (.mount): Control mount points for file systems
    * Timer units (.timer): Schedule tasks to be run at specific times


  Systemd Commands:
    * To enable a service: systemctl enable <service.name>
    * To disable a service: systemctl disable <service.name>
    * To start a service: systemctl start <service.name>
    * To stop a service: systemctl stop <service.name>
    * To restart a service: systemctl restart <service.name>
    * To reload a service: systemctl reload <service.name>
      reloads the service without restarting the service. ex: update to service
      config without interrupting the service operation.
    * To check service status: systemctl status <service.name>
    * To switch between targets: systemctl isolate <target.name>

    * To analyze time taken by each service during boot:
        systemd-analyze  blame
    * To view the tree of systemd services and the dependencies
        systemd-analyze critical-chain

    * Use below command to reload the systemd manager after creating new/
      editing unit file.
        systemctl daemon-reload

  Journalctl commands:
    * To view boot logs: journalctl -b
    * To view previous (ex: -1 index) boot logs: journalctl -b -1
    * To view the activities of a specific unit (ex: service, socket):
        journalctl -u <unit.name>
