
I2C (Inter Integrated Circuit)
	I2C is a two-wire communication protocol that is commonly used to connect
	low-speed devices like microcontrollers, I/O interfaces, A/D and D/A converters,
	EEPROMs, and other peripherals in embedded systems.
	SCL - serial clock carries the clock signal
	SDA - serial data carries the data, allows master and slave devices on the
				bus to send and receive data

	I2C protocol allows for multiple slave devices to be connected to a single
	master device, or for multiple masters controlling one or more slave devices.

	In general, the I2C protocol is best applied on projects where simplicity of
	design and low manufacturing costs are more important than speed. The
	standard data transfer rate associated with the I2C protocol is just 100 kbps,
	although speeds of up to 5 Mbps are possible with certain types of devices
	that are configured to use I2C in "fast mode" or "ultra-fast mode".


SPI (Serial Peripheral device)
	SPI is a four-wire communication protocol that can be used to connect
	microcontrollers to a versatile range of devices on the same serial bus,
	including temperature and pressure sensors, A/D and D/A converters,
	memory devices, LCDs, and more.
	SCLK (Serial Clock)	- clock signal from master to all slave devices on the
				serial bus
	MOSI (Master Output Slave Input) - data o/p from master to the slave devices
	MISO (Master Input Slave Output) - data i/p to master from the selected slave
				device
	SS (Slave Select) - no direct slave to slave communication. The master device
			uses the Slave Select wire to select which slave device on the bus it will
			be communicating with before sending a data transmission.

	SPI is synchronous
	SPI is a simple protocol with little overhead
	SPI supports full-duplex communication
	SPI communication does not have a means for acknowledgment or flow control
	SPI does not use much board space

UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter.)
	At a high-level, a UART is simply a microchip that enables communications
	between a computing device (PC, embedded system, etc) and other equipment.
	UART chips are used to convert inbound serial data to parallel data for the
	system to read and conversely converts outbound parallel data to serial before
	sending it on to other systems.
	A UART’s main purpose is to transmit and receive serial data.
	Data is transmitted as frames.
	UART FRames consist of
		* Start/Stop bits
		* Data bits (5-9 bits, LSB first)
		* Parity bit (optional, used for error detection). Indicates Even or odd parity (number of 1s in the data bits)
			(0 - for even parity, 1 - odd parity)

	UART is hardware
	supports full duplex
	two pins
	one to one communication (one device to another)
	Slower than SPI
	costlier than SPI
	asynchronous communication
	used in diagnostic displays

	UART uses 2 wires: 1 for transmit (or Tx) and one for receive (or Rx) (Plus Ground)
	UART communication is asynchronous, meaning that it is not synchronized using a clock
		(transmitter and receiver do not share a common clock)
	UART has a max communication distance of 15 meters
	UART leverages shift registers to convert serial communication to parallel communication
	UART is commonly used as a “serial port” on computers or in microcontrollers
	UART supports full-duplex communication

	UART may be better suited for applications that have to travel slightly more
	distance such as diagnostic displays or other applications that require RS-232
	support.
