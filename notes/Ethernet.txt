Ethernet
--------

Versions:
  1976 - First version of Ethernet was implemented
  1978 - Dell, Intel, Xerox published, "Ethernet II" (DIX Ethernet)
  1983 - IEEE 802.3 standard was released

  Both Ethernet II and IEEE 802.3 standards are almost identical, both are
  simply referred as Ethernt.

Ethernet Frame:
  An Ethernet frame is a structured packet of data used for communication over
  Ethernet networks. It contains a preamble, destination and source MAC
  addresses, a type field, data, and a frame check sequence (FCS).

  Ethernet II
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Preamble | Destnation Address | Source Address | Type/Length | DATA (PAD) | CRC32 |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  IEEE 802.3
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Preamble | SFD | Destnation Address | Source Address | Type/Length | DATA (PAD) | CRC32 |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Premble (7 bytes for 802.3 or 8 bytes for Ethernet II):
  In Ethernet II, all 8 bytes had the pattern of 10101010.
  In 802.3, the first seven bytes has this pattern (10101010).
  Premble is not really a part of the actual frame, it only precedes every
  frame. It helps synchronize the receiving device's clock with the incoming
  data. The preamble is a 7-byte piece of data that signals an Ethernet frame
  has started. It can be thought of as a “digital handshake” that ensures the
  recipient is on the same page about what will be sent.

Start Frame Delimiter: (1 byte)
  This marks the end of the preamble and indicates the start of the frame.
  It's a specific bit sequence (10101011) that signals the beginning of the
  frame payload.

Destination MAC Address: (6 bytes)
  A 6-byte (48-bit) field specifying the MAC address of the device to which the
  frame is being sent.

Source MAC Address: (6 bytes)
  This is another 6-byte field that indicates the MAC address of the device
  sending the frame.

Type/length: (2 bytes)
  A 2-byte field specifying either the type of protocol in the payload
  (Ethernet II) or the length of the payload data (IEEE 802.3).
  Ethernet II - type of the protocol - ex. IPv4, IPv6, ARP
  IEEE 802.3 - length of the data - specifies the size of the payload. This
  helps the recipient device to efficiently parse and process the frame.

  How to differentiate, whether the ethernet frame is of Ethernet II type or
  IEEE 802.3 type?
  The values in the type/length portion helps here. If the value is less than or
  equal to 1500, then it is the length of the data (IEEE 802.3 type).
  If it has the value greater than or equal to 1536, it means Ethernet II (type)
  The values in between have no meaning (1501 - 1535).

Data and PAD: (46 to 1500 bytes)
  The data field is the actual contents of the message, carrying the payload of
  the Ethernet frame. Data can vary in size and includes the information to be
  delivered to the recipient. The payload is between 46 and 1500 bytes in
  length.

CRC32: Cyclic Redundancy Check (4 bytes) (also FCS - Frame Check Sequence)
  A 4-byte (32-bit) field for error checking. It helps the receiving device to
  identify any errors in the frame during transmission.
  The CRC is a checksum value calculated from the contents of the frame,
  including the destination MAC address (excluding premble).


Interpacket Gap (IPG):
  It is the idle time between packets. After an Ethernet frame is sent,
  transmitters wait a very short period of time before transmitting the next
  frame, in order to allow the receiver to know that the transmission of a
  frame is over.


Ethernet Address:
  Ethernet MAC address consists of 6 bytes.
  ex: 00:01:42:A9:C2:DD
      00:01:42 -> Vendor ID
      A9:C2:DD - > Host ID

  Ethernet address also consists of two special bits.
  * First special bit indicates whether the address is unicast or multicast
  address. Unicast represents a single device, Multicast addresses represent a
  group of devices (ex: all printers in the network).

  address: 06:b2:d9:a2:32:9e
  Most significant byte - 06 . convert to binary - 00000110
  The least significant bit is 0, hence, it is representing a unicast device

  address: 05:b2:d9:a2:32:9e
  Most significant byte - 06 . convert to binary - 00000101
  The least significant bit is 1, hence, it is representing a multicast device

  * Second special bit indicates whether the address is globally unique or not.

  address: 06:b2:d9:a2:32:9e
  Most significant byte - 06 . convert to binary - 00000110
  The second least significant bit is 1, hence, this address is not globally
  unique. IEEE never assign such address to any vendor. This address can be
  assigned to a specific device for specific reason (ex: privacy, network
  virtualization).

  address: 05:b2:d9:a2:32:9e
  Most significant byte - 06 . convert to binary - 00000101
  The second least significant bit is 0, hence, this address is globally unique.
