Protocol Buffers:
    Protocol buffers are language-neutral, platform-neutral extensible
    mechanism for serializing structured data.
    * Compact data storage
    * Fast parsing
    * Optimized functionality through automatically-generated classes
    * .proto file extension

Versions:
    proto2, proto3, editions

How it works:
    * Create a .proto file to define data structure
    * Generate code using the protoc compiler
    * Compile PB (auto-generated source for the proto file) code with project code
    * Use PB classes to serialize, share and de-serialize data

How to define:

    Package declaration helps to prevent naming conflicts between different projects. 
    Similar to C++ namespace definition.

    message: fundamental unit for defining the structure of data
    Each field in the message has a unique field number.
    
    optional: The field either set or unset. When it is set, it contains a value and
    it will be serialized to the wire. When unset, it will return default value. it
    will not be serialzied to the wire.

    required: do not use. Remvoed from proto3 and editions.

    repeated: A field type can be repeated zero or more times in a well-formed message

    map: this is a paired key/value field type

    C/C++ style comments can be added in the proto file
        // or /* ... */

    For C++, the compiler generates a .h and .cc file from each .proto, 
    with a class for each message type described in your file.

Field data types:
    double, float, int32, int64, uint32, uint64, sint32, sint64, bool, string, bytes
    *sint32, sint64, signed int, much efficient than int32, int64 to represent negative numbers

    default field value:
        string: empty string
        bool: false
        numeric types: 0
        bytes: empty bytes

Sample message:

    syntax = "proto2";

    package sample;

    enum PhoneType {
        PHONE_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED = 0;
        PHONE_TYPE_MOBILE = 1;
        PHONE_TYPE_HOME = 2;
        PHONE_TYPE_WORK = 3;
    }

    message PhoneNumber {
        string number = 1;
        PhoneType type = 2;
    }

    message Person {
        string name = 1;
        int32 id = 2;
        string email = 3;
        repeated PhoneNumber phones = 4;
    }
