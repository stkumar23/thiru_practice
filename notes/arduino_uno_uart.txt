UART Serial Port communication in Arduino Uno board using USB TTL
-----------------------------------------------------------------
This exercise demonstrates that using USB TTL, Arduino board LED
can be programmed (ON, OFF) using the input from serial port pin (UART).

* Connect Arduino board to the PC
* Write below sample program in IDE and upload that to the board
        // LED is programmed using the PIN 13
        int led = 13;
        int input = 0;

        void setup() {
            // put your setup code here, to run once:
            Serial.begin(9600); // serial port baudrate
            pinMode(led, OUTPUT);
        }

        void loop() {
            // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
            if (Serial.available() > 0) {
                input = Serial.read();
                delay(10);

                if (input == '1') {
                    digitalWrite(led, HIGH);
                    Serial.println("LED is ON");
                }
            
                if (input == '0') {
                    digitalWrite(led, LOW);
                    Serial.println("LED is OFF");
                }
            }
        }
* Disconnect the board from PC and remove the power cable
* Use the USB TTL board and make below connection
    - USB TTL TX pin to Arduino RX pin
    - USB TTL RX pin to Arduino TX pin
    - USB TTL 5v pin to Arduino 5v pin
    - USB TTL Ground pin to Arduino Ground pin
* Now, connect the USB TTL to USB port of PC, make sure that the Arduino board's power led is ON
* Open the IDE, from Tools menu, select the board as Arduino and port as "/dev/ttyUSB0"
* Open the Serial Monitor from the Tools menu
* Type 1 and enter. Verify that board's LED (L) is ON. Check the output "LED is ON" in the Serial Monitor
* Type 0 and enter. Verify that board's LED (L) is OFF. Check the output "LED is OFF" in the Serial Monitor

Troubleshooting:
* In case, the serial port is failed to connect, make sure that dialout is set as the group owner of the port.
        ls -l /dev/ttyUSB0
        crw-rw-rw- 1 root dialout 188, 0 Jul 19 23:06 /dev/ttyUSB0
 * Also, run the below command to set the permission. sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyUSB0
