AddressSanitizer
----------------
It is a memory error detector tool for C/C++ programs. It is also known as ASan.
This tool is much faster than valgrind. The only drawback is, unlike valgrind the 
program has to be re-compiled with the below option to use the address sanitizer.

To use the AddressSanitizer, the program has to be compiled with -fsanitize=address
  ex: g++ -fsanitize=address -g -o example example.cpp

Other compilation options
  To get a reasonable performance add -O1 or higher
  To get nicer stack traces in error messages add -fno-omit-frame-pointer

// Sample program to demo the use of address sanitizer
// compile using - g++ -fsanitize=address -O1 -g -o bufoverflow_1 bufoverflow.cpp

#include <iostream>
int main()
{
  
  char *chArray = new char[10];
  // heap-buffer-overflow
  chArray[10] = 'c';

  char stack[10];
  // stack-buffer-overflow
  stack[11] = 'c';

  delete[] chArray;

  return 0;
}
